                <p id = "text">My name is Fabrizio Botalla, I am originally from Torino Italy. My wife and I are currectly living in Oahu, Hawaii. One of my favorite things to do is to play soccer.
                One thing about me is that if I am passionate about something I always strive to be the best at it. While I was definitely not the best at playing soccer, I have gotten to certain levels that I never thought I would.
                Recently I started to develop a strong passion for programming, I hope to exceed my expecations there too. 
                My biggest accomplishment in life was to marry my college sweetheart. We have been happily married for almost two years. We love to spend time together and do fun activities.
                While living in Europe, we travelled to 10 countries in one year! I consider myself a travel lover.<br>
                One of my strongest qualities is the fact that I am a good problem solver. In many of my previous jobs I was recognized for this quality of mine. If I cannot solve a problem 
                I usually take the necesary time to reasearch and come to a solution. This quality of mine applies to both programming and also daily lives activities. 
                For the past two years I have been working in the IT department for two companies. While I enjoy working as an IT, I am excited to start my career in software development.
                If you have any good references for jobs around your area that I could look into please contact me here: botalla.fabrizio@gmail.com.</p>
